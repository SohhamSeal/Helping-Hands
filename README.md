# Helping Hands

Are you tired of seeing inadequate disaster management in your state? Are you worried about the lack of support from emergency management organizations during disasters? The Helping Hands project is here to lend a hand.

## Introducing Helping Hands
Helping Hands is a web-based database management system designed to help organizations that deal with disaster management. It consists of login/signup pages for the administrator employees of the organization and fulfills the basic requirements of the organization.

## Why Helping Hands?
Let's face it, disasters such as wildfires, hurricanes, flash-floods, and earthquakes, are a serious business, and emergency management organizations such as the National Disaster Management Authority often fall short of supporting every citizen across the country. This has led to state-based organizations taking action during such disasters. However, they lack proper structure and reliability, particularly in rural areas. Our project aims to facilitate disaster management organizations and rescue groups with a user-friendly and efficient database and a website that connects them to organizations and speeds up rescue-unit dispatch. 

## How does Helping Hands work?
Helping Hands is a DBMS for a generic disaster management organization. It consists of an increasing database (modifiable) with many tables, that is assumed to help an organization of similar job description. The system is aimed at facilitating the backend processes in the organization by providing an ERP-like system that will automate the existing manual system with the help of computerized databases and software.

## The Benefits of Helping Hands
By using Helping Hands, you will be able to control the entire database of the organization from one place and with ease. The organizationâ€™s functioning relies a lot on time management, thus automating its database, will preserve plenty of time, facilitating the organization to concentrate better on resource utilization and other more important activities. This will allow your organization to work more efficiently and provide clear and speedy information transfer to facilitate rescue operations.
